            <h2>What is Abuse?</h2>

            <p>Domestic abuse is when your partner uses a pattern of coercive and assaultive behaviors to obtain power and control over you. The American Heritage Dictionary defines coercion as “to force to act or think in a certain way by use of pressure, threats, or intimidation or to compel; to dominate, restrain, or control forcibly; and to bring about by force or threat.”</p>

            <p>Domestic abuse impacts individuals of all ethnicities, races, ages, educational levels, religions, and sexual orientations. Women are overwhelmingly the victims of abuse (with 85-90% of victims of domestic abuse being women abused by male partners), but men can also be victims of abuse by male or female partners and domestic abuse also occurs in same-sex relationships.</p>

            <p>Each individual’s experience with domestic violence is unique, so there is no “one way” an abusive relationship should look. But many of the tactics that abusive people use are similar, due to the fact that they are very effective tools to control and dominate others. The Power and Control Wheel, developed by survivors of domestic abuse in 1984, portrays the different tactics that perpetrators of domestic violence use in their relationship to obtain power and control. “Power and control” is at the center of the wheel because this is what your partner is trying to obtain. Sexual and physical violence are listed on the “tire” of the wheel because they are tactics used more intermittently to keep the dynamic in place.  Listed below are eight separate tactics that work very effectively to control a person. You might have experienced some or all of these tactics. Some examples of how the tactics are used are listed below, but know that there are many more ways in which abusers use the following tactics.</p>

            <p><strong>Emotional Abuse:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Verbal putdowns</li>
                <li>Name calling</li>
                <li>Making you think you are crazy / gaslighting</li>
                <li>Playing mind games</li>
              </ul>

            <p><strong>Isolation:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Preventing you from seeing family and friends</li>
                <li>ontrolling what you do or who you talk to</li>

              </ul>


            <p><strong>Coercion and threats</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Threatening to leave</li>
                <li>Hurt their partner</li>
                <li>Coercing you into doing things you don’t want to do</li>
                <li>Threatening to ruin you reputation</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Economic Control:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Controlling all of the money</li>
                  <li>Ruining credit</li>
                  <li>Giving an allowance</li>
                  <li>Sabotaging your finances</li>
                  <li>Making their victims dependent on them for food, shelter, and other necessities</li>
                </ul>

              <p><strong>Male privilege:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Treating you like a servant</li>
                  <li>Making all of the big decisions</li>
                  <li>Being the “master of the castle”</li>
                  <li>Having different rules for you than your partner has for himself</li>
                </ul>


              <p><strong>Children:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Threatening to take the children away</li>
                  <li>Being emotionally abusive in front of the children</li>
                  <li>Teaching the children to not respect you</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Minimizing concerns, denial, and blame:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Not taking abuse seriously</li>
                    <li>Blaming abusive behavior on the you</li>
                    <li>Telling you everything is your fault</li>
                  </ul>

              <p>If your partner is successful in obtaining power and control over you using the above tactics, he might not decide to use physical or sexual violence in the relationship. Most of the tactics listed above do not currently meet the criminal threshold for what is considered to be domestic violence, but that does not make these tactics any less frightening, damaging or hurtful.</p>

              <p>In addition, your partner may sexually assault or coerce you (such as constant demand for sex, making your partner do something sexually they don’t want to do), and use physical force (such as pushing, slapping, hitting, kicking, biting, or beating you up) in your relationship. These particularly frightening attacks often show you that the your partner is willing to use physical or sexual force, which makes threats and intimidation in future cases often just as powerful and frightening as physical assault or sexual assault.</p>

              <p>Abuse is NEVER your fault. It is important to remember that your partner has control over their decisions and when individuals behave abusively, it is a choice they have made to act in this way. Your partner might blame his behavior on your, or make excuses for his behavior (such as he was drinking, or stressed out at work, or you didn’t do something right), but it is important for you to know that you did not cause any abuse. Many abusers can be extremely manipulative after an abusive incident, which might include crying and begging for forgiveness, promising that it will never happen again, promising to change, or buying you gifts.</p>
